								<img class="pull-right award-image" src="images/award.jpg">
								<p>Preston Wealth Advisors was named in the August 2014 issue of Pensions &amp; Investments as a ‘Top Performing Manager.‘  Theodore J. Doremus, managing director of Preston Wealth Advisors said,  “This is quite an honor for us. The fact that Pensions &amp; Investments included Preston Wealth Advisors in its selection of ‘Top Performing Managers,’ signals that our constant efforts towards business excellence are paying off.  We are proud to be included in this recognition.”</p>

												First, we make trading decisions based on data, rather than emotion. Preston Wealth Advisors has developed a proprietary, patent-pending algorithm that constantly monitors the market, identifies growth sectors, and pinpoints specific performing ETF’s and Mutual Funds. Sector agnostic, the algorithm analyzes data daily and alerts us to buy or sell based on indicators we’ve selected and continuously tune. A Preston Wealth Advisor reviews the data before ever executing a trade.<br><br>
												Secondly, we take more aggressive positions when the market rises and sell when indicators signal it will fall. In the event neither fixed income nor equity investments offer enough return to justify the risk, our advisors can move 100% to cash. In 2008, our algorithm protected clients, limiting their losses in our most aggressive portfolios to just 5%, when the S&amp;P dropped 37%.

														<p>Preston Wealth Advisors offers a differentiating approach to portfolio management. Private and Institutional investors alike seem to appreciate our proprietary algorithm’s uncanny ability to predict market shifts in order to advance client objectives.</p>
														<h3>Low Duration Income Portfolio</h3>
														<p>Preston’s Low Duration Income Portfolio is a Cash/Certificate of Deposit or a Money Market alternative for clients who seek high liquidity with minimal risk, and returns greater than a savings account. This Portfolio encompasses 39 different fund choices and each sector is represented by several different funds, allowing us to assess and purchase the best performing fund in any given sector. In addition to the traditional income sectors including short-term government, municipal and corporate bonds, the Low Duration Income Portfolio also includes sectors such as global bonds, high yield funds, and total return funds to increase portfolio returns. This strategy is best suited for conservative investors.</p>
														<div class="pull-right col-md-5"><img src="images/img-portfolio.png" alt=""></div>
														<h3>Income Portfolio</h3>
														<p>Our Income Portfolio provides a mix of income and investment appreciation. In addition to the traditional income sectors such as short-term government, municipal and corporate bonds, the Income Portfolio also includes sectors such as global bonds, high yield funds, and convertible bond funds. By including these sectors, we provide investors with the opportunity to increase returns. The Income Portfolio encompasses 25 different fund choices and each sector is represented by several different funds, allowing Preston Wealth Advisors to assess and purchase the best performing fund in any given fund sector.</p>
														<h3>Total Return Portfolio</h3>
														<p>We designed the Total Return Portfolio for clients who want to participate in tactical asset management, but aren’t comfortable investing in aggressive growth. This portfolio can provide investors with greater stability in today’s volatile markets while providing competitive returns. In addition to the traditional income sectors such as government, municipal and corporate bonds, our Total Return Portfolio also includes sectors such as convertible securities, utility funds, and equity income funds. Including these sectors provides investors with the opportunity to participate in a total return growth strategy. The Total Return Portfolio has 40 different fund choices and each sector is represented by several different funds, thereby allowing us to assess and purchase the best performing fund in any given fund sector.</p>
														<h3>ETF Moderate Growth</h3>
														<p>Preston Wealth Advisors created the ETF Moderate Growth portfolio for capital appreciation. This portfolio functions like our ETF Growth Strategy but with a more conservative ETF universe, excluding some of the more aggressive sector funds used in the growth strategy. The Moderate Growth portfolio also has the option to “go anywhere” — 100% cash, 100% bonds or 100% equities.</p>
														<h3>ETF Growth Portfolio</h3>
														<p>Preston Wealth Advisors designed the Growth Portfolio for investors seeking maximum capital appreciation through a global tactical strategy. Unlike other funds, the Growth Portfolio has zero allocation restrictions. Based on market conditions it can go 100% cash, 100% bonds, or 100% equities. The Growth Portfolio utilizes 40 different asset class choices and each asset class encompasses several different funds. This portfolio can utilize sector specific ETF’s to help increase performance, allowing us to assess and purchase the best performing fund in any given fund sector.  However, no sector can exceed 50% exposure except for cash.</p>

												<h3>Professional Athlete Services</h3>
												<div class="row">
													<div class="col-md-12 align-left">
														<p>Our team offers investment and financial management services to professional athletes, managing their current financial life and helping to secure their financial future, post-sports career.<br><br>

														You understand discipline, or you wouldn’t be a professional athlete. The same discipline that got you into the big time can turn your lucrative present into a comfortable future. But you must act now. Since you’re unlikely to earn at the same rate when you retire, your current earnings need to last. The only way to ensure they will is to have a comprehensive game plan and the discipline to execute it. Consider that the average NFL career lasts 31⁄2 years. Just 2 years after their football careers end, 78% of NFL players are bankrupt, or nearly there.<br><br>

														<div class="align-right col-md-5"><img src="images/img-athlete2.png" alt=""></div>

														While career and bankruptcy statistics vary widely from sport to sport, the resounding drumbeat remains: get your financial house in order while you’re earning. Professional Athlete Services is one of our primary practices, led by managing partner and former college athlete, TJ Doremus. Our client roster includes professional athletes from the NHL and MLB. We’re knowledgeable about your unique job demands and have developed tailored concierge financial services to meet your specific needs.<br><br>

														First, we teach you how your finances work, so you’ll understand the decisions we make on your behalf. Then, in addition to helping you plan, save, and invest for the future, Preston Wealth Advisors helps you manage your life now. We automate your bills, provide counsel and documentation when buying a house, and even oversee everyday services such as housekeeping and pool service.

														Then we turn our attention to your post-sports career, helping you explore ways to capitalize on current skills and experience to launch into the next chapter of your life. Any player can live like a king for a few years. With our help, you can live like a prince for the rest of your life. Getting caught up in the spending frenzy of a professional league lifestyle is easy. Preston Wealth Advisors allows you to enjoy your earnings responsibly while protecting your net worth long term.

														Learn how we can help you work toward securing your financial future.</p>

												<p class="disc-text">Actual composite performance results represent all client accounts within each applicable portfolio managed by Preston Wealth Advisors during the corresponding time period. The composite performance results reflect time-weighted rates of return, the reinvestment of dividends and other account earnings, and are net of applicable account transaction and custodial charges, Preston Wealth Advisors’ investment management fees, third-party solicitor/advisor fees, and the fees assessed directly by each unaffiliated mutual fund holding that comprised the Portfolio. The reinvestment of dividends and other earnings may have a material impact on overall returns. For reasons including variances in Portfolio account holdings, variances in the investment management fee incurred, market fluctuation, the date on which a client engaged Preston Wealth Advisors’ investment management services, and any account contributions or withdrawals, the performance of a specific client's account may vary substantially from the indicated Preston Wealth Advisors’ composite performance results. A portion of each account may be actively managed in an attempt to respond to changing conditions.
												<br><br>
												Past performance may not be indicative of future results and the performance of a specific individual client account may vary substantially from the composite performance results. Therefore, no current or prospective client should assume that future performance will be profitable, or equal either the Preston Wealth Advisors’ composite performance results reflected above, or the performance results for any of the comparative index benchmarks provided.
												<br><br>
												Preston Wealth Advisors’ managed accounts may own assets and follow investment strategies which cause them to differ materially from the composition and performance of the indices or benchmarks shown on performance or other reports. Because the strategies used in the accounts or portfolios involve active management of a potentially wide range of assets, no widely recognized benchmark is likely to be representative of the performance of any managed account. Widely known indices and/or market indices are shown simply as a reference to familiar investment benchmarks, not because they are, or are likely to become, representative of past or expected managed account performance.
												<br><br>
												The historical performance results of the comparative indexes do not include dividends. The results do not reflect the deduction of transaction and custodial charges, nor the deduction of an investment management fee, the incurrence of which would have the effect of decreasing indicated historical performance results. The historical index performance results are provided exclusively for comparison purposes only, so as to provide general comparative information to assist an individual client or prospective client in determining whether a specific Portfolio meets, or continues to meet, his/her investment objective(s). It should not be assumed that account holdings will correspond directly to any of the comparative indexes.
												<br><br>
												The S&amp;P 500 Index is an unmanaged index and includes a representative sample of large-cap U.S. companies in leading industries. The NASDAQ Composite Index is an unmanaged market-value weighted index of all common stocks listed on NASDAQ. The Dow Jones Corporate Bond Index is an unmanaged index of 96 bonds issued by leading U.S. companies designed to represent the market performance, on a total-return basis, of investment-grade bonds. Unmanaged indices may not be invested in directly.
												<br><br>
												Different types of investments and/or investment strategies involve varying levels of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific investment or investment strategy (including the investments purchased and/or investment strategies devised by Preston Wealth Advisors’ will be either suitable or profitable for a client's or prospective client's portfolio and may result in a loss of principal. Accordingly, no client or prospective client should assume that the above portfolios (or any component thereof) serve as the receipt of, or a substitute for, personalized advice from Preston Wealth Advisors, or from any other investment professional.
												<br><br>
												All performance results have been compiled solely by Preston Wealth Advisors, are unaudited, and have not been independently verified. Information pertaining to Preston Wealth Advisors’ advisory operations, services, and fees is set forth in Preston Wealth Advisors’ current disclosure statement, as same is on file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, a copy of which is available from Preston Wealth Advisors upon request.</p>
