												First, we make trading decisions based on data, rather than emotion by using sector agnostic algorithm that analyzes data daily and alerts us to buy or sell based on indicators we have selected and continuously tune. A Preston Wealth Advisor reviews the data before ever submitting a trade.<br><br>
												Secondly, we take more aggressive positions when the market rises and sell when indicators signal it will fall. In the event neither fixed income nor equity investments offer enough return to justify the risk, the portfolios can move 100% to cash. In 2008, the algorithm would have limited the losses in our most aggressive portfolios to just 5%, when the S&amp;P dropped 37%.

												<h3>PWA ETF Conservative Growth Portfolio</h3>
												<p>PWA’s ETF Conservative Growth Portfolio is designed for investors seeking capital appreciation with a lower risk tolerance. The ETF Conservative Growth strategy will invest in broad equity sector funds with no sector specific ETF exposure. This portfolio utilizes 8 positions to further diversify risk. A full complement of fixed-income ETF’s are also available for the model to choose from. Investments will be allocated between equities and fixed-income based upon an analyses of market conditions. No single position will account for more than 50% of the portfolio and if our indicators signal a downtrend in either the equity or fixed-income space, the portfolio can be moved partially or entirely to cash in order to seek preservation of your principal investment. The strategy seeks to outperform a 30% Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Total Return Index (“S&amp;P 500®”) and 70% Barclay’s Aggregate Bond Index (“Barclays”) blend. Investments involve risk and you could lose the principal invested.</p>

												<h3>PWA Total Return Portfolio</h3>
												<p>We designed the Total Return Portfolio for clients who are seeking growth primarily through capital appreciation and secondarily through income. This portfolio can provide investors with greater stability in today’s volatile markets while providing competitive returns. In addition to the traditional income sectors such as government, municipal and corporate bonds, our Total Return Portfolio also includes sectors such as convertible securities, utility funds, and equity income funds. Including these sectors provides investors with the opportunity to participate in a total return growth strategy. The Total Return Portfolio has 40 different fund choices and each sector is represented by several different funds, thereby allowing us to try and assess and purchase the best performing fund in any given fund sector.</p>

												<h3>PWA ETF Moderate Growth Portfolio</h3>
												<p>We created the ETF Moderate Growth portfolio for capital appreciation with a moderate risk tolerance. This portfolio functions like our ETF Growth Strategy but with a more conservative ETF universe, excluding some of the more aggressive sector funds used in the growth strategy, however, this portfolio may consist of either domestic, international sector-specific ETFs or commodity ETFs.  The Moderate Growth portfolio does not necessarily have bond exposure at any given time, but retains the ability to utilize bonds or cash in order to attempt to protect principals.</p>

												<h3>PWA ETF Growth Portfolio</h3>
												<p>We developed the Growth Portfolio for investors seeking maximum capital appreciation through a global tactical strategy. Unlike other funds, the Growth Portfolio has zero allocation restrictions and based on market conditions can go 100% cash, 100% bonds, or 100% equities. The Growth Portfolio utilizes 40 different asset class choices and each asset class encompasses several different funds. This portfolio can utilize sector specific ETF’s to help increase performance, allowing us to seek to assess and purchase the best performing fund in any given fund sector. However, no sector can exceed 50% exposure except for cash.</p>

												<h3>PWA OTC Hedge Portfolio</h3>
												<p>PWA’s OTC Hedge portfolio is designed for investors who are seeking to enhance investment performance while reducing risk and attempting to protect their assets from marketing volatility and uncertainty.  The PWA OTC Hedge holds 1 position at a time going either long or short the Nasdaq 100 (via and ETF) or investing in long-term Treasury bonds or cash.</p>

												<h3>PWA Low Duration Portfolio</h3>
												<p>Our Low Duration Income Portfolio is a Cash/Certificate of Deposit or a Money Market alternative for clients who seek high liquidity with minimal risk, and returns greater than a savings account. This Portfolio encompasses 39 different fund choices and each sector is represented by several different funds, allowing us to assess and purchase what we believe to be the best performing fund in any given sector. In addition to the traditional income sectors including short-term government, municipal and corporate bonds, the Low Duration Income Portfolio also includes sectors such as global bonds, high yield funds, and total return funds to help increase portfolio returns. This strategy is best suited for conservative investors and is currently closed to new investors.</p>

												<h3>PWA Income Portfolio</h3>
												<p>Our PWA Income Portfolio (previously the PWA Income Portfolio) provides a mix of income and investment appreciation. In addition to the traditional income sectors such as short-term government, municipal and corporate bonds, the Income Portfolio also includes sectors such as global bonds, high yield funds, and convertible bond funds. By including these sectors, we provide investors with the opportunity to increase returns. The Income Portfolio encompasses 25 different fund choices and each sector is represented by several different funds, allowing Preston Wealth Advisors to try and assess and purchase the best performing fund in any given fund sector.  This portfolio is currently closed to new investors.</p>

												<h3>PWA Dynamic Treasury Portfolio</h3>
												<p>Our PWA Dynamic Treasury Portfolio is intended for investors who are seeking a more aggressive way to invest in the U.S. Treasury markets or utilize a strategy to provide non-correlation to their outside equity positions. This portfolio aims to take advantage of volatility in the US 20-30 Year Treasury by actively trading several mutual funds within the strategy. The portfolio will consist of 1 mutual fund at a time. Like all PWA portfolios, cash is always an option for our portfolio managers. The portfolio managers will either go long or short based on the current market conditions of the U.S. 20-30 Year Term Treasury.</p>
												<h3>PWA Dynamic Income Portfolio</h3>
												<p>We conceived the Dynamic Income Portfolio for investors who are seeking a mix of income, investment appreciation and to take advantage of market volatility in the U.S. Treasury markets. In addition to traditional sectors such as short-term government, municipal and corporate bonds, this portfolio can also include sectors such as global bonds, high yield bonds, convertible bonds, dividend paying companies and utilities to name a few. As a general rule, no single sector other than cash will make up more than 50% of the portfolio at any given time. 2 “static” positions can be used to provide additional yield, as well as to provide stability through non-correlation to the equity markets. Within the portfolio, our portfolio managers will utilize a long/short U.S. Treasury (PWA Dynamic Treasury) strategy in order to try and take advantage of the volatility in the Treasury markets. 3 scenarios are possible on this side of the portfolio: Long, Short or Cash.</p>
												<h3>PWA Dynamic Growth Portfolio</h3>
												<p>Our PWA Dynamic Growth Portfolio is designed for investors who are seeking capital appreciation with a hedging feature providing non-correlation to the equity markets. 60% of the portfolio will be invested in the PWA ETF Growth portfolio and 40% of the portfolio will be invested in the PWA Dynamic Treasury portfolio. In addition to traditional equity sectors, the PWA ETF Growth portfolio includes a full complement of fixed-income sectors such as government bonds, convertible funds, high yield bonds and inverse funds. PWA utilizes both domestic and international sector specific funds, as well as a full range of commodity funds in order to seek the best possible return.  Outperforming sectors will be over-weighted in order to maximize returns. No single position will account for more than 50% of the portfolio and if our indicators signal a downtrend in either the equity or fixed-income space, the portfolio can be moved partially or entirely to cash in order to seek preservation of the principal investment. To provide non-correlation, our portfolio managers will utilize a long/short US Treasury (PWA Dynamic Treasury) strategy in order to try and take advantage of the volatility in the Treasury markets. 3 scenarios are possible on this side of the portfolio: Long, Short or Cash.</p>
												<h3>PWA Dynamic Hedge Portfolio</h3>
												<p>PWA’s Dynamic Hedge Portfolio is formulated for investors who are seeking to enhance investment performance while reducing risk and protecting their assets from typical market volatility and uncertainty. The portfolio is made up of 2 separate strategies running simultaneously. On the equity side, only 1 position is held at a time, investing in either the OTC 100, the OTC Short 100, long-term Treasury bonds or cash. Utilizing a disciplined tactical approach in the Dynamic Hedge Portfolio, our advisors buy and sell 1 of these 3 carefully selected ETFs based on current market conditions. If our indicators signal a downtrend, the entire portfolio can be moved to cash in an attempt to preserve the principal investment. On the fixed income side, our portfolio managers will utilize a long/short US Treasury (PWA Dynamic Treasury) strategy in order to try and take advantage of the volatility in Treasury markets. There are 3 possible scenarios on this side of the portfolio: Long, Short or Cash.</p>

												<h3>Professional Athlete Services</h3>
												<div class="row">
													<div class="col-md-12 align-left">
														<p>As a professional athlete, you understand the importance of dedication, discipline and teamwork. The same recipe that launched you into becoming a “pro” can turn your lucrative present condition into a comfortable future. Since you are unlikely to earn money at your current rate when you retire, your present-day earnings need to last.  We believe the best way to make that happen is to construct a comprehensive game plan and continue to have the discipline, dedication and teamwork to execute it. As you know, waiting even a day to execute a plan or in your case, a workout, can be detrimental to your future. 78% of NFL players are bankrupt, or nearly there, just 2 years after their football careers end.

														<ul>
															<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/1-in-6-nfl-players-go-bankrupt/" target="_blank"><li>CBS News: 1 in 6 NFL Players Go Bankruput</li></a>
														</ul>

														While career and bankruptcy statistics vary widely from sport to sport, the resounding drumbeat remains: get your financial house in order while you are earning. Since, Professional Athlete Services is one of our primary practices, led by our CEO and former college athlete, TJ Doremus, we are knowledgeable about your unique job demands and have developed tailored concierge financial services to meet your specific needs.  As a part of our Professional Athlete Services, we offer investment and financial management services working with you to manage your current financial situation and helping to secure your financial future, post-sports career.  Our current client roster includes professional athletes from both the NHL and MLB. We look forward to joining your successful financial team.<br><br>

														<div class="align-right col-md-5"><img src="images/img-athlete2.png" alt="Preston Wealth Advisors"></div>

														Our game plan begins with educating you on how your finances work; this typically is a team effort as we collect information on your current situation and work with you to create a financial picture of where you are and why.  After all, how can you play a game you do not know how to play? The next step is typically a financial plan that would include where you want to be in the future with the best “play” to get you there.  Then, in addition to helping you plan, save, and invest for this future, we help organize your financial life now by working with you to “automate” bills to minimize your financial worries and/or stress while on the road.  Once complete, we turn our attention to your post-sports career, helping you explore ways to capitalize on your current skills and experience to launch into the next chapter of your life. Any player can live like a king for a few years. With our help, you can live like a prince for the rest of your life. Getting caught up in the spending frenzy of a professional league lifestyle is easy. Preston Wealth Advisors allows you to enjoy your earnings responsibly while helping to protect your net worth long term. Learn how we can create a game plan to help secure your financial future.</p>
